There once was a small boy who lived on the beach.

He is very handsome and with furry...

arms, which helped keep him warm in the frigid nights of winter when wind would blow from beyond the horizon.

One day, a beautiful girl appeared on the beach without consciousness. The small boy warmed her body by holding her tightly in his furry arms.

She was scared by the fur, however, and left to go to a party down on Mifflin. The end.
